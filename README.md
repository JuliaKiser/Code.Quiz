## Your Task

This weeks unit prepped us to create a code quiz utilizing all that we have learned so far html, css,javascript and Web APIs. As you make your way through my quiz you find that it is timed, you have multiple choice selections with some fun css features, and I implemented local storage to be able to retain scores and display in the final page.

This was a challenging one when it came to javascript but it was fun to see how I have developed from our first unit using html and css, grasper it way better.
